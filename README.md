# Big-Data-Project-1
Using Hadoop MapReduce, these programs work together to generate recommendations based on a social network. The program takes in a program which contains 100,000 movie ratings in the format user, movie, and rating. With this data, the file is read into ut.txt and is looking for all the items that were rated greater than or equal to 3 and writes the user and movie to a new output file called ut.txt which holds the user to item relationships. Then this ut.txt file is taken in as input to uu.java and that looks for users that have shared interests in the same items. When two users like the same item, both of the user id's are written to the new output file called uu.txt. Finally, uu.txt is taken in as input for ur.java and ut.txt is read in through Java fili I/O to have both data accessbile in the program. Then we ultimatley generate recommendations based on who is friends and what items a particular user has liked. This all done using the Hadoop MapReduce framework.
